About :
------
QDvGrab is a simple, nice and efficient Gui in Python 3 and QT5 for dvgrab, a command line tool. The only main purpose is to grab your films from a DV or HDV Camcorder in an easy way. This is the main idea behind this project i.e easy to install, easy to use. None command lines needs.

Features :
--------
* Nice Design
* Simple utilisation
* Modern program
* Complete Preferences
* Essential features of Dvgrab
* No command lines required

Short Manual :
------------
* Download it from the github project homepage
* Open it everywhere you want (usually, in your home or in the opt repository)
* Open a console at the root directory
* Type the following line : python qdvgrab/main.py
* Go to Preferences screen
* Choose good parameters for you i.e DV or HDV camecorder, format capture, dvgrab is present, output folder, ...
* Keep in mind that your preferences won't be keep so you'll need to check them each time you run it if they are always present. This issue will be resolved soon.
* Go to back the main GUI
* Check if the appropriated button is available i.e HDV Acquisition for HDV Camcorder
* Click on the start button
* Wait until the end of the process

System requirements/User requirements :
-----------------------------------
QDvGrab is a Python 3 and QT 5 program then you need to install them for using QDvGrab. 
QDvGrab is only for unix systems.
Python 3 is now the default version on all major distributions.
QT 5 is the widget toolkit and need probably to be installed (need to be confirmed).
Obviously, QDvGrab is a GUI for the program dvgrab so you need to get it before.
To resume, you need to install before :
* python 3
* pyqt5
* QT 5
* dvgrab

Additional Information :
--------------------
QDvGrab is a tiny tool done on my free time and mainly in Winter when I have not a lot of work at home. It is a way to learn more on Python an QT 5 like I'm not a studen and a software program, just a user who need in a GUI a simple application.
Hope that you 'll enjoy like I have a lot of enjoy to do it.

Enhancements/Bugs :
----------------
* the setup file doesn't work. Needed more test for use in production.
* the config file is not still available. And then the program doesn't keep your preferences.
* the code for grabbing film is not yet put done so the application can't be used now.
* in a first step, will be only tested with Dv Camcorders.
