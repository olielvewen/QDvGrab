Installation
------------

For the moment, just open a console in the src folder and type:

 ```
python qdvgrab.py
```

* Manjaro

    Like explained above, python3 is the default version so type :
    ```
    python qdvgrab.py
    ```
    
* Linux Mint/Ubuntu

    Works fine on this distribution but you must use at least Linux Mint 17 and Ubuntu 14.04. 
    Should be work on any previous version on which you can install Qt5, PyQt5 and Python3.
    However, the python default version is the version 2 and not the 3. So you should type :
    
    ```
    python3 qdvgrab.py
    ```
